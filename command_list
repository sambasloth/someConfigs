A good way to check link status of wired connection with dmesg
	dmesg -T | grep enp0*

Getting info on connection:
	sudo ethtool enp0s25

Nmap scans: -oN (output NORMAL)
Grep current line and 2 previous lines
grep -w (current line) -B 2 (two previous lines) -A 1 (next lines) -C 3 (Both previous and next lines)

SSH Tunneling (for when you need to log into a router behind a NAT, and have access to the network)

ssh ubnt@10.0.5.149 -L 8291:10.0.0.100:8291
10.0.5.149 = CPE 
10.0.0.100 = Local address of router


Unifi Set inform
set-inform http://mitecexchange.net:8080/inform

Remote Desktop using rdesktop
rdesktop -g 80% -5 -K -r clipboard:CLIPBOARD -u <username> <ip> 

View DNS and more info from DHCP
nmcli dev show eth0

Viewing Wi-Fi Signal
